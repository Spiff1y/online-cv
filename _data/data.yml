    - role: Lloyds Bank Work Experience
      time: March 10th - March 14th, 2025
      company: Lloyds Bank
      details: |
        From the 10th to the 14th of March this year, I participated in Lloyds Bank's Work Experience at Wellington Place in Leeds. 
        Whilst I was there, I developed the 8 key skills in their Ethos and was taught about several key roles at the bank, 
        such as Financial Advisory, Investment, Mortgages, Customer Service, and Cyber Security. I shadowed each role for a day and 
        learned about how the bank runs and the different careers available. This experience helped me improve my transferable skills 
        and workplace readiness.

    - role: Duke Of Edinburgh Award
      time: 2022-2023
      details: |
        During my Silver Duke of Edinburgh expedition in the Yorkshire Dales, I navigated challenging terrain, carried essential gear, 
        and worked closely with my team to stay on course. I developed map-reading and problem-solving skills, adapted to changing conditions, 
        and learned to stay focused under pressure. The experience also improved my teamwork and communication, as we had to support 
        each other and manage tasks effectively. It was a demanding but rewarding challenge that strengthened my resilience, 
        planning, and leadership abilities.

    - name: Age UK Youth Worker
      start: 2024 - Present
      organization: Age UK
      details: |
        I have been working at the Age UK charity for almost a year. Once a week, I help people use technology and aid them when necessary. 
        For example, if they need to set up a new iPhone, I show them how to set it up and write key steps down with diagrams if necessary. 
        This role also includes walking them through how to make email accounts and app logins, or how to use Google Maps or the Internet. 
        This role has helped me develop key skills such as clear communication, efficient note-taking, and analytical skills.

        such as effective communication, patience, good timekeeping skills, and the ability to break down tasks into simple steps.
