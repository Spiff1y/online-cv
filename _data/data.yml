  - role: Lloyds Bank Work Experience
    time: March 10th - March 14th 2025
    company: Lloyds Bank
    details: From the 10th March to the 14th of March this year, i participated in Lloyds Bank's Work Experience at Wellington Place in Leeds. Whilst I was there, I developed the 8 key skills in their Ethos, and was taught about several key roles at the bank, such as Financial Advisory, Investment, Mortgages, Customer Service and Cyber Security. I shadowed each role for a day, and learnt about how the bank runs, and all the different careers that were available. This helped me improve my transferable skils, and made me better in a workplace as a whole.
  - role: Duke Of Edinburgh Award
    time: 2022-2023
    details: |
     During my Silver Duke of Edinburgh expedition in the Yorkshire Dales, I navigated challenging terrain, carried essential gear, and worked closely with my team to stay on course. I developed map-reading and problem-solving skills, adapted to changing conditions, and learned to stay focused under pressure. The experience also improved my teamwork and communication, as we had to support each other and manage tasks effectively. It was a demanding but rewarding challenge that strengthened my resilience, planning, and leadership abilities.
